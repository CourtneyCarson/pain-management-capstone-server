It feels like the whole side of the head hurts. This sensation is typical of what you experience with a migraine headache (Simons, Travell, and Simons 1999). The upper three suboccipitals on each side control nodding and tilting and, if afflicted with trigger points, can limit these movements and cause a stiff neck.'),
